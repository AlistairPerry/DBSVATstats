# DBSVATstats
## Calculation of VAT summary and subregion statistics

The calculation of summary VAT and subregion statisitics from files extracted within LEADDBS (http://www.lead-dbs.org/). Matlab software is required.

The codes here were initially performed upon 64 PD patients receiving DBS stimulation on the STN, as analysed in Mosley et al. (2018, Neuroimage: Clinical)

We note these codes are to be used on files extracted after utilizing Lead DBS software. We hence acknowledge Lead DBS software and it's developers, as well as the Acolla and BigBrain datasets for providing open-source anatomical information that were implemented in the current study.
